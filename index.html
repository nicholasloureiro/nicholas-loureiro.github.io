        <p><strong>About Me:</strong> From a young age, I was fascinated by performance starting with racing toy cars and imagining myself as the following Formula 1 star. While my dreams of becoming a professional race car driver may have hit a speed bump, my love for performance never wavered.

            I channeled that enthusiasm into my education, graduating with a degree in Mechanical Engineering, where I learned to make things go fast (well, at least on paper). Building on that foundation, I embarked on a Mechatronics Engineering Bachelor's degree. My passion for speed took a detour into the world of databases, where I discovered a different kind of performance.
            
            With a gear shift in my career, I embraced the role of a backend developer, coding my way through complex systems. Though it was thrilling, I found my true calling lay in the art of fine-tuning databases and optimizing their performance. 
            
            Currently, I'm engaged in a challenging Python project, and also on a mission to conquer cloud certifications (OCI and AWS) and learn German.</p>
